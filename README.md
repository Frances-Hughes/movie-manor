Welcome to Movie Manor, an application meticulously crafted utilizing a tech stack comprising Material UI, React, Framer Motion, Granim, and the TMDB API. Within this platform, you'll find a seamless integration of a 'dark mode' interface along with search bar functionality, enhancing user experience and satisfaction.

Please note if you wish to view the entire project via github (rather than the vercel deployed site I have provided in my portfolio), you will need to generate your own TMDB key (or, alternatively, I can provide an example key on request) to be saved in a .env file which will contain the string: "REACT_APP_API_KEY=apikeygoeshere"

To generate your own key, visit: https://www.themoviedb.org/

Kind Regards,

Frances Hughes
